# Atlet (WIP) üèÉ

### [Atlet documentation](https://atlet.deno.dev)

As clich√© as it sounds, Atlet was built with simplicity in mind. Sometimes, it might be slightly overwhelming to do even something simple, using modern tools and frameworks.

Now don't get me wrong, framworks such as Svelte, Vue, React, Angular, Solid and bunch more, they are doing an incredible job to provide developers with reliable tools, capable of building huge, reliable and complex websites **and you should primarily use those** if you're building something serious.

But in case you don't, or you're fully aware of what you're doing and you just want to quickly write or prototype something, this might be the tool for you :)

PS: Feel free to open a new issue :)

### Notice about versioning 
I made an error in versioning an open-source library, and I would like to point out that **there might, and probably will, be breaking changes until a v2 at least.** Please keep that in mind before using this framework. ‚úåÔ∏è
